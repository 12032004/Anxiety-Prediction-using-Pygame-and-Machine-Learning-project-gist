# Anxiety-Prediction-using-Pygame-and-Machine-Learning-project-gist

## Overview
This project aims to predict anxiety levels based on various input features using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook provided contains data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, encoding)
- Machine learning model selection and training
- Performance evaluation using various metrics
- Visualization of results

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If no `requirements.txt` is available, install the common libraries used in ML projects:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Anxiety_prediction_orginial_1_.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (ensure the correct file path is provided in the notebook).
2. Run the preprocessing steps.
3. Train the machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
5. Visualize key insights and predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains features related to anxiety levels.
- Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.
- Modify the `data_preprocessing` section in case of any discrepancies.

## Model Details
The notebook explores multiple models, such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (if applicable)

## Results & Evaluation
- Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores.
- Visualizations like feature importance and correlation matrices are included.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by:
- Improving model accuracy
